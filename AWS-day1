> ## *<mark>What's Cloud Computing?</mark>*

Cloud computing is like renting a camera instead of owning one. Imagine you need a camera for a trip, but instead of buying a camera and taking care of the maintenance, you simply rent a camera when you need it and return it when you're done.

In the same way, cloud computing is a service where you can rent computing resources, such as storage space or processing power, from a provider instead of buying and managing your physical infrastructure like servers or data centers. The provider takes care of the hardware, software, and maintenance, while you focus on using those resources to run your applications or store your data.

For example, let's say you're a photographer who wants to back up and store your high-resolution photos. Instead of buying external hard drives or setting up your server, you can use a cloud storage service like Google Drive or Dropbox. You upload your photos to the cloud, and they are securely stored on the provider's servers. You can access your photos from anywhere with an internet connection, and the provider takes care of backing them up and ensuring their availability.

In this example, the cloud storage service acts as the "rental camera" for your data storage needs. You don't have to worry about managing physical storage devices or maintaining the infrastructure; instead, you pay for the storage space you use and enjoy the convenience and accessibility of your photos being stored in the cloud.

Cloud computing simplifies technology for individuals and businesses, offering convenience, scalability, and cost-effectiveness. It allows you to focus on using the computing resources you need without the burden of owning and managing the underlying infrastructure.

> ## ***<mark>What is AWS?</mark>***

AWS, or Amazon Web Services, is a cloud computing platform provided by Amazon. Just like how you can rent a camera when you need it instead of buying one, AWS allows you to rent computing resources whenever you need them.

For example, let's say you have an idea for a website or a mobile app. Instead of setting up your servers, you can use AWS to rent virtual servers, called Amazon EC2 instances, to run your application. You can choose the size and specifications of these virtual servers based on your needs, just like choosing the right tool from the toolbox.

> ***<mark>Certainly! AWS provides three primary types of services:</mark>***

1. Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS).
    
2. Platform as a Service (PaaS).
    
3. Software as a Service (SaaS).
